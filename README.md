There has been a lot of talk lately about the Ethereum "merge," an upgrade of the existing blockchain network to become more efficient by moving to a "proof of stake" system rather than a "proof of work" system. Although the efficiency benefits of this system are obvious, this article argues that the "merge" may subject the Ethereum network to scalability, decentralization, and/or security problems down the line. 

As a side note, I think that it is very interesting that this upgrade is being called a "merge," just like what happens when the code of one git branch is merged into another. In a way, it is exactly the same. A feature under development (namely, the move toward "proof of stake" rather than "proof of work") was developed under a side branch, and now that it has been tested and is stable, has been merged into the main branch and is being used in production. This is causing a lot of people who may not be part of the software engineering world to begin to understand some of the processes that we use everyday.

I found it interesting to learn more about the "merge" and also be introduced to the possible issues the Ethereum network could face as a result, and I hadn't previously considered how this topic could help the general public understand software engineering concepts so I thought that was interesting to bring up -Anvi
